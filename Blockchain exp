Blockchain

Data structure used:
linked list- as each node can store multiple attributes

Operation:
Each node has an attribute that stores the hash of the previous node, this serves the main linking condition for blocks in a blockchain

Time Complexity:
for n number of blocks, as we have to traverse to the end of the linked list, so time complexity is O(n)

Space Complexity:
for n blocks, space complexity is O(n)
